The USBee32-S2 is an Open Source, General Purpose, USB (Type A and Type C) Breakout Development Board designed using ESP32-S2-WROOM Module. 

The features of USBee32-S2 [printed circuit board](https://github.com/dhairyashah1/USBee32-S2/tree/4-layer) are:   

* Small form factor of 68.4mm x 27.9mm
* Four layered customly designed general purpose Development board
* Uses ESP32-S2-WROOM RF module
* Breakout ports for both USB - Type A and USB - Type C
* Uses CH340C which gives a high current output converting USB to UART logic
* Powering modes for the ESP - Either can be used
  - USB - A: Using a USB A Male Cable
  - USB - C: Using a USB C Male Cable(Typical Mobile charger cable)
  - VI Pin: Supplying this GPIO pin with external 5V
  - JST Battery Port
* Has an On - board debuggable Neopixel (RGB Led)
* Has an ESD protection device which protects the circuit from electrostatic discharge and prevents malfunction/breakdown of the device
* Uses MCP73831 for charging LiPo battery
* Can use it as a power/communicating device for a joystick/ game controller
* Space efficient PCB with integrating majority components in SMD type package 
* Autoselect power source, i.e., battery or USB
